## ✅ What this proves (no ambiguity)

### `/succes.html`

* **Status: 200 OK**
* **HTML body transferred**
* **Content-Type: text/html**
* **No 304**
* Page renders correctly

### `/test-download`

* **Status: 200 OK**
* JSON returned
* Signed R2 URL generated successfully

👉 Frontend ⇄ Backend ⇄ R2 is now **fully wired and stable**.

## 🧱 Your system is now solid

You have:

* ✔ Express server behaving correctly

## 🚀 Next steps (clean order, no rush)

Now that the foundation is stable, here’s the **correct order** forward:

### **1️⃣ Connect Stripe → success redirect**

* After payment → redirect to `/succes.html`
* Optionally pass session/payment ID

### **2️⃣ Send the PDF link by email**

* Same signed R2 URL
* Use:

  * Sender.net (easy)
  * OR Node + SMTP (more control)

### **3️⃣ Lock it down (later)**

* Prevent unlimited refresh → regenerate links
* Optional one-time-use logic

---

### 🟢 Tell me what you want next

Just answer with **one word**:

* `stripe`
* `email`
* `security`
* `cleanup`

We’ll proceed **slow, clean, and correct** from here.
