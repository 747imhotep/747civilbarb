Perfect! Let’s focus on a **practical, non-legal GDPR checklist** for your site. This is purely technical/UX — not legal advice — but it ensures your pages behave “GDPR-friendly” for visitors.

## ✅ Quick GDPR Sanity Checklist (Practical)

### 1. **Consent on Contact Form**

* [x] Checkbox is **required** before submission (`required` attribute).
* [x] Text clearly explains data use:

  > “En envoyant ce message, vous consentez au traitement de vos données personnelles selon notre Politique de confidentialité.”
* [x] Link to **Privacy Policy** is present and functional.
* [x] Checkbox **cannot be pre-checked**.

---

### 2. **Privacy Policy Access**

* [x] Privacy Policy is **linked in the footer** of every page.
* [x] Separate page, readable, with headings:

  * Données collectées
  * Finalité de l’utilisation
  * Services tiers
  * Durée de conservation
  * Vos droits

---

### 3. **No Tracking Without Notice**

* [x] You do not currently have third-party analytics scripts (Google Analytics, etc.) — if added, must inform visitor or ask consent via popup/banner.

---

### 4. **Form Submission / Data Storage**

* [x] Formspree is used — ensure **no hidden prefilled fields** send data you don’t need.
* [x] Only essential fields collected: name, email, message.
* [x] Sender.net is only used for sending content/news — check their privacy compliance.

---

### 5. **Cookies**

* [ ] If any cookies are added in the future (tracking, ads, analytics), a **cookie consent banner** is required.

---

### 6. **Right to Access / Delete**

* [x] Contact page explicitly mentions how a visitor can request data deletion or modification.

---

### 7. **Technical / UX**

* [x] Checkbox and GDPR text **visible and readable** on mobile.
* [x] Links open in the same tab (or clearly marked).
* [x] Legal text and forms are easy to scroll/read — no hidden elements.

---

### ✅ Quick Practical Notes

* All current pages (Contact, Privacy, Terms) **pass a basic GDPR UX sanity check**.
* The only addition needed if you ever add cookies or analytics is a small **consent banner**.

If you want, I can make a **tiny reusable GDPR CSS snippet + small consent banner** that you could drop in any page — no JS headaches, fully mobile-friendly, and visually consistent.

Do you want me to do that next?
